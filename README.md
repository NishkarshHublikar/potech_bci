## Overview

**POTECH** is an innovative Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) project that makes advanced neurotechnology accessible outside expensive laboratories. Our solution captures EEG signals using affordable sensors and converts them into real-time commands, enabling direct interaction between humans and machines.
## Key Features

- **Accessible NeuroTech** - EEG capture using affordable sensors for students, researchers, and innovators
- **Real-Time Interaction** - Direct device control through neural and muscular activity
- **Practical Applications** - Healthcare, education, and daily life integration
- **Sustainable Innovation** - Recognized under Low Carbon Emission category by MSME
